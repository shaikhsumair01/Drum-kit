🥁 JavaScript Drum Kit
A simple, fun and interactive drum kit built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation and event handling to create a virtual drum kit that plays sounds when images are clicked.
🚀 Features
- Clickable drum images that trigger respective drum sounds
- Responsive and intuitive UI
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly codebase
🛠️ How It Works
Each drum component is represented by an image element in the HTML. JavaScript is used to:
- Add event listeners to these images
- Play the corresponding audio file when a drum image is clicked
